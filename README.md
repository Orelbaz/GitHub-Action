# CI/CD Pipelines

Welcome to the documentation for our project pipelines. We have four main pipelines in this project, each serving a specific purpose and technology stack.

## 🚀 Main Pipeline: Kubernetes Deployment

Our primary pipeline leverages Kubernetes for deployment. It allows us to efficiently manage and scale our application in a containerized environment.

### Features

- Automated deployment to a Kubernetes cluster
- Dynamic scaling based on resource utilization
- Health checks and self-healing mechanisms
- Integration with monitoring and logging tools


## 🐳 Docker Pipeline

The Docker pipeline focuses on building and distributing container images of our application.


## 🛠️ Docker Compose Pipeline

Our Docker Compose pipeline facilitates local development and testing using Docker Compose.


## ⚙️ Ansible Pipeline
